# FFXIV Sapphire Setup

A script for setting up the FFXIV Sapphire Server on Ubuntu

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viion/ffxiv-sapphire-setup/master/setup.sh
bash ./setup.sh
```

#### Note:

You will need at minimum a 2GB droplet to build the ffxiv-server files. After that you can resize it back down.
